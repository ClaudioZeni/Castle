        Ensemble of ridge regression force fields in Python.
        
        This repository is based on the ACE descriptor [1] as descibed in [2] and implemented in [3]
        
        
        # Instructions
        
        Install julia-1.5.3
        
        go in julia (julia in terminal)
        
        press ] to go to package manager
        
        run the following:
        
        
        	registry add https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/MolSim.git
        	add JuLIP, IPFitting
        	pin JuLIP@v0.10; pin IPFitting@v0.5
        
        Download ACE from https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACE.jl, branch dev-v0.8.x.
        
        Then, install the julia Python package with:
        
        	pip install julia
        
        Finally, install Castle with (from inside the repository where setup.py is):
        
        	pip install .
